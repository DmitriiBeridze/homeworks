                <p>Hi there,</p>
                When Smashing Magazine approached Netlify, they managed a
                dizzying number of tools across different functional areas of
                their site including their magazine, content, e-commerce
                platform, comments engine, subscription service and member
                login.

              <td width="35%">
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    6x their site speed, from a load time of 800 ms to just 80
                    ms
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Migrate from several disparate tools to a single unified
                    platform
                  </li>
                  <li>

                    WordPress
                  </li>
                  <li>

                    reliability and speed.
